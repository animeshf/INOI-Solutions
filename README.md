# IOITC 2015 Practice
This repository contains solutions to selected problems from the IARCS Judge, SPOJ, CodeChef and Codeforces that I'd solved while preparing for the Indian National Olympiad in Informatics and International Olympiad in Informatics Training Camp in 2015. All solutions are in Java.

Note that this is a very old repository, so most of the code does not follow style guidelines and might not present the cleanest way to solve a problem. The intention of this repository is to help students who prefer Java to prepare for the INOI.
